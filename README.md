#Purpose
The purpose of the project is to explore the effectivess of advanced machine learnign techniques using multiple tiers of NFL data. This project proposes machine learning techniques can be used to predict the next play given a series of previous plays, the winner of a game, and the performance of a player in a single game. These predictions could be useful when applied to live play calling strategy, personnel analysis, sports betting, and fantasy football. This dataset also offers many unique challenges including a relatively small datasets as NFL teams only play 16 games in a regular season.

This project will also compare various machine learning algorithms and compare their strengths and weaknesses. We also examine the effect of data aggregation as data can be trained on a play level, drive level, quarter level, half level, game level, or season level.


#Data Sets
1. Play by play Data: Consists of summary of each play in each game including, time, down, yards to go, pass/run, distance, current score, as well as other metrics. From 2009-present.
2. NFL Combine data: A set of metrics used to measure the athleticism of players as well as one test the measue mental aptitude.
3. Coach history: Head coach, offensive coordinator, defensive coordinator
4. Rosters: The players that make up a team
5. Weather: Weather of games 
6. Injury History: Football is a contact sport with high frequency of injuries. 

#Algorithms
1. ANNs - Deep Belief, Recurrent, Fuzzy
2. SVMs with Kernel Transformations
3. Reinforcement Learning

#Potential Challenges
The size of the dataset is relatively small as each teams plays 16 regular season games and run approximantly 50-60 playes per game. We hope to mitage this issue by training on the historical data going back 6 years. It could be assumed coaches talented enough to earn multi million dollar contracts do not have predictable tendencies as they would be exploited by opposing coaches.
